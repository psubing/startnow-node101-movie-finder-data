In this project we're going to:
  - Create a server using the `Express` framework
  - Log all incoming requests with the `morgan` logging library
  - Accept requests for the Open Movie DataBase (OMDB) API
  - Make the requests to the OMDB using the `axios` library
  - Cache, or store, the responses for subsequent requests
  - Ensure the data is updated at least once a day
